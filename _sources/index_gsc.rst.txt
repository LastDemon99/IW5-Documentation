===
GSC Language, also known as "game script code," serves as Call of Duty's scripting language, heavily based on C++. While its syntax closely resembles that of C++, it incorporates distinct characteristics such as object mutability, this allowing modification after creation, and dynamic typing, meaning there's no need to specify variable data types upon declaration.
