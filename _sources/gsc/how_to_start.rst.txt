How to start
============
Place or create a .gsc file in **%localappdata%/plutonium/storage/iw5/scripts**. The game will then inspect these files and initialize the function named ``init`` within them. Therefore, to initialize our script, we must always start by creating this function.

.. code:: c

    init()
    {

    }
